# warzone2100-audio-adjustment
Addresses [issue #1200](https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/issues/1200) in the Warzone2100 project.

The purpose of this repository is to review the video sequences for Warzone2100 and
determine which sequences need their volume adjusted.

The respective .ogg audio files for the sequences can be found in the sub-directories with the **'audio_'** prefix. There is an audio folder for each of the sequence types (cam1, cam2, cam3). The assessment of each of the audio files is contained in the **analysis.txt** file.
